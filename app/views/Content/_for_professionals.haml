  # Why use Homespree?
  --------------------

  Our goal is to help you grow your business by offering a radically easier way for you to connect with homeowners,
  provide estimates, and manage payment.

  Below are some key points about our service:

  ### Customized

  Get referrals from homeowners in your area for the services you provide.

  ### Qualified

  You will only be contacted for appointments by homeowners who have agreed to an approximate estimate based on your
  pricing guidelines.

  ### Effective

  We're exclusive. We only sign up a few of the best service professionals in each geographic location to ensure you
  both get the value you deserve.

  # How We're Different
  ---------------------

  We are not a lead generator. Our industry experience and pricing model help us conveniently provide you qualified
  customers, not leads.

  On Homespree, you are only engaged for a project after a homeowner reviews your profile, agrees to an approximate
  estimate that is automatically generated based on your guidelines, and submits their credit card info.

  Don't waste time bidding on other sites. Sign up for Homespree today to get started.


  # How does it work?

  ### Homeowners request an appointment

  Only homeowners who have reviewed your profile, have agreed to your approximate estimate and have submitted a credit
  card are able to request an appointment.
