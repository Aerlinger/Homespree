  # Take the stress out of home improvement
  -----------------------------------------

  Do you need some work done around your home? Let us help you hire the right contractor at the right price. We enable
  you to easily request estimates, schedule the job and even pay the contractor.

  ##Step 1 - Request an estimate

  Instead of waiting around in-person for contractors to show up and provide estimates, we enable you to request mutiple
  bids online at your own convenience. And we give you a few options!

  **1) Get 3 instant estimates using our online request form**

  This option is best if you know all the details of your project (e.g. square footage, current finish, etc). Once you
  fill out our standard online forms, we'll immediately provide you 3 bids from quality local contractors.

  **2) Submit photos and a description of you project**

  Lost your tape measure or are uncetain about a few details? This option is for you. Simply give us a brief description
   of the services you require and upload a few photos. We'll then create a project request for you and provide 3 bids
   from quality local contractors in our network.

  **3) Call, chat or email us**

  Feeling a little helpless? That's ok! Let us offer you live assistance. You can give us a call at 908-461-5094, chat
  with us from the tab on the bottom of your screen, or email us at support@myhomespree.com. We'll talk to you about
  your project needs and capture all the details we require to provide 3 bids from quality local contractors.

  ##Step 2 - Select a contractor

  We've done quite a bit of work to find the best contractors in your area and assemble profiles to show them off. Upon
  receiving the 3 estimates, be sure to carefully review each contractor's profile. Portfolios, reviews, length of
  service and other details provide information to make a better hire.

  ## Step 3 - Schedule the job

  Great! You've selected a contractor to achieve a more safe, comfortable and beautiful home.

  The next step requires you to select a date and time for the contractor to begin work. If you'd like to get a better
  feel for the contractor before beginning the project, schedule a meeting using our scheduling tool. To schedule a job,
   you will be required to create an account.

  ## Step 4 - Pay, enjoy and repeat

  Upon completion of your job, be sure to let your contractor know if there are any outstanding items you would like him
  or her to address. Your satisfaction is our top priority. We only charge you and pay the contractor when you are 100%
  happy with the work.

  We hope your enjoy the improvements our contractors have made in your home. Our goal is to make home improvement
  enjoyable and easy to purchase. Be sure to use Homespree for any future home improvement projects.
