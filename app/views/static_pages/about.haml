      %p In an age when you can buy just about anything with a single click of your smartphone, it seems backward that hiring a home service professional requires dozens of phone calls, voicemails and meetings.

      %p Our mission is to make purchasing home improvement services stress-free, while empowering professionals to grow their businesses.

      %p Today, many homeowners rely on friendly referrals to hire contractors. Others have visited review sites or online lead generators.

      %p While these methods can be helpful, they often leave you with a ton of questions regarding price and quality.

      %p At Homespree, we want to put those concerns to rest. We’re here to help you connect with the best contractors in your area, get competitive estimates and manage payment.

      %p We currently service painting requests in the tri-state area, but have big plans to expand to more services and regions soon.

      %p
