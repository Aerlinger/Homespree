        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <br>

        <p>So itâ€™s 2013 and your living room has wallpaper that was installed in 1982. You start thinking that it might
          just be time for an update. But how do you start?</p>

        <p>Traditionally, you may look in the phonebook for the numbers of several painters. You call up a list of 5 and
          have them come out to give you an estimate. Unfortunately, most will probably arrive late or not show up at
          all.</p>

        <p>This is how the Homespree mobile app can help. Nothing is more convenient when it comes to requesting home
          improvement estimates.</p>

        <h3>Download Mobile App</h3>
        <br>

        <p>The Homespree mobile app will be available in the App Store for iPhone and iPad and the Google Play Store for
          Android devices beginning in mid-2013.</p>

        <h3>Request an estimate</h3>
        <br>

        <p>Homespree is designed to make the process of receiving home improvement estimates easy and convenient.
          After registering as a new user, you are ready to upload your first request.
          Start by selecting which type of project you need completed. In the example above, you may choose Painting >
          Interior Painting > Whole Room > Remove Wallpaper and Paint.</p>

        <p>Next, you will be prompted to take several pictures of your project using the camera on your device.
          Multiple images will give contractors a better idea of the work that needs to be completed and ensure a more
          accurate estimate.</p>

        <p>For additional details, you can add comments below each picture after they are taken. Following image
          capture, you will be asked to input several additional details. In the above example, you will be asked to
          enter the dimensions of the room, whether or not you want the trim and/or ceiling painted, etc.</p>

        <p>
          Finally, select by what date you need the estimate and by when you will need the project complete.</p>

        <h3>Review bids</h3>
        <br>

        <p>After you submit your project request, you will be notified by email when a contractor enters a bid. If you
          have selected to allow push notifications from the application (recommended) you will also be alerted
          through your device. After the period to submit bids has ended (based on the timeline you specify), you can
          review all the estimates using several built-in filters. These filters include price, contractor rating, and
          # of contractor reviews. You have the ability to view past ratings and read past reviews.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Homespree provides you with the information to make a more informed decision. The app allows you to choose
          a contractor based on several factors, including price, rating and reviews. </p>

        <p>Please note that the estimates provided through Homespree are only valid based on the disclosed details.
          Any undisclosed details or changes to the request may result in an adjustment to final price. It is
