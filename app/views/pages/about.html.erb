    <p style="max-width: 500px"><a href="http://www.myhomespree.com">Homespree</a> was founded in Brooklyn, NY in late 2012. In the aftermath
      of
      Hurricane Sandy, roommates Kyle Gesuelli and Joe Gesualdo began talking about the home improvement industry
      and
      how the traditional process of requesting and submitting home improvement estimates was antiquated and
      inefficient.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width: 500px">Both saw an opportunity to leverage the rapid adoption of smartphones and mobile applications to improve
      the experience for both homeowners and contractors.
