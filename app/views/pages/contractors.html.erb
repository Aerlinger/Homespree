        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <br>

        <p>So you just completed a full basement renovation. Unfortunately you don’t have any new jobs lined up.
          Situations
          like this are typically very stressful. How will you pay your crew? How long until a new job comes along?
          Should
          you spend more money on marketing? This may seem daunting, but Homespree can help.</p>

        <p>With Homespree, you don’t need to rely solely on broad advertising to acquire new customers. Instead of
          waiting
          for new customers to approach you, Homespree allows you to engage homeowners who are actively seeking a
          contractor.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Mobile app</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>Download</h3>
        <br>

        <p>The Homespree mobile app will be available in the App Store for iPhone and iPad and the Google Play Store for
          Android devices beginning in mid-2013.</p>

        <br>

        <p>While registering, you will be prompted to submit your zip code and service area radius. This, along with
          your
          selected home improvement areas of expertise will dictate which project requests are visible.

        <h3>Submit an estimate</h3>
        <br>

        <p>After registering as a new user, you will be ready to submit your first bid. You can filter for projects
          based
          on type, distance, and timeline. </p>

        <p>Make sure to scroll through all photos and details to get the full sense of the work. If you require more
          details, there is an option to contact the homeowner. </p>

        <p>Bids from other contractors are not visible to ensure that you provide as accurate an estimate as possible.
          Keep in mind, price is only one factor upon which the homeowner will make the hire. </p>

        <p>If the homeowner has chosen you for the job, you will receive a message via email and the app on your device,
          if you have selected to allow push notifications (recommended).

        <h3>Ratings and Reviews</h3>
        <br>

        <p>Homeowners will hire a contractor based on several factors, including price, ratings and reviews. To improve
          your chances of being selected, ensure that you have an adequate number of quality reviews. </p>

        <p>The mobile app allows you to pull in existing reviews from Yelp. If you do not have a Yelp account, it is
          important that you reach out to past customers to submit reviews on your Homespree profile.</p>

        <h3>Pricing</h3>
        <br>

        <p>Homespree is a free service for homeowners. Homespree charges contractors a small commission on the price of
          the jobs awarded. It is always free to join Homespree and submit estimates. Payment will only be collected if
          the job is awarded to you. The commission is applied to the agreed upon price of the estimate.
